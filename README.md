# Supported Versions

At all times, refer to the `mainnet`, `testnet`, and `preprod` git tags to understand which versions of this codebase are compatible with the corresponding EigenLayer environment.


| Environment    |     Version   |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| Mainnet                 |       [1.3.0](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenpod-proofs-generation/releases/tag/1.3.0) |
| Testnet(Hoodi & Holesky)|       [1.3.1](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenpod-proofs-generation/releases/tag/1.3.1) |

# Introduction

PEPE Changes how we prove balances to EigenLayer. For more information, check out some of the links below.

# Usage

- If you want to produce and submit proofs onchain -- either immediately, or by writing to a file to submit later -- check out our [CLI](./cli/README.md). The CLI can produce both credential and checkpoint proofs, and submit them onchain if given a private key.

- If you want to produce proofs from within Golang, please use `cli/core:GenerateValidatorProof` or `cli/core:GenerateCheckpointProof` for our high-level APIs. These will handle downloading beacon state, interfacing with an eth node, and generating the relevant proofs. Lower level APIs are available in `prove_validator.go`.
